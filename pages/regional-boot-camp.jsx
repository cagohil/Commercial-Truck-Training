              Ken Taylor & Associates/Commercial Truck Training is enhancing its
              focus on our updated “Regional Boot Camps” for 2022 and beyond!
              The reviews for our past Regional Boot Camps have been almost
              perfect “10s” and the updates to these events will give even more
              value as we move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is an outline of what to expect when hosting a Regional Boot
              Camp in your territory:
            </p>

            <div className="col-lg-6">

                <p>
                  <strong>Attendance Cost :</strong>
                  $595/person – FYI: some OEMs will co-op or split cost, some
                  will not. Some have paid an advance fee to us based on this
                  cost and anticipated attendance then collected individually
                  from dealerships. We recommended KTA/CTT billing right to
                  individual dealerships so it’s one less headache for you, but
                  we can discuss options further.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Schedule :</strong>
                  Generally start 1 pm first day, until 5 pm. 8 am to 4 pm
                  second day. The 1 pm start allows attendees to travel that
                  morning and get lunch on their own before arriving.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Location :</strong>
                  You pick session location. Most are in hotels, but several
                  have been at OEM training centers, upfitters, or even
                  centralized dealerships.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Cost to Host :</strong>
                  We ask that you do three things for success – a) market the
                  event to register as many attendees as possible; b) pay for
                  and/or secure the meeting location; c) pay for lunch on the
                  second day. Anything additional is welcome, such as a dinner
                  on night one, but not necessary. Ken Taylor & Associates will
                  handle workbook printing, other handouts, our travel,
                  accommodations, and meals not already mentioned.

            <p>
              <strong>Accommodations :</strong> We HIGHLY recommend allowing
              attendees to find their own hotels versus a block at one location.
              This allows them to stay at hotels where they may have “points
              accounts” while avoiding one less headache for you in arranging it
              all! We have regularly provided a list of hotels within a certain
              radius, and can set that up if you wish.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> Registration : </strong>
              We’ll handle that right here on our website. They will have a link
              to come to the site, register, give us payment information, then
              confirmations. You will be asked to verify your email address
              through our registration database provider (POWr) so you can
              receive an email notification each time someone registers for an
              event you’re connected with.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> General Expectations : </strong>
              We like to have a minimum of 15 at these events, and have had as
              many as 41. Average is about 20-23. These are a little more
              “lecture-style” than our Ultimate Boot Camps due to the numbers,
              but still produce a high amount of participation and engagement.
